## Description 
Share your vacation adventures with friends, family, and strangers through a simple photo blogging app. Create an account and log in to create blogs, read blog posts, and view image galleries of your users' recent trips. 

This group project challenged us to use Handlebars for the first time outside of a class activity, navigate different routes, require login authentification, and save session data to track users. One of our main challenges was working collaboratively and distributing work evenly.
